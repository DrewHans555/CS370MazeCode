# CS370MazeCode
This repository contains code written in Python for Blackburn College's Fall 2016 Artificial Intelligence class CS370.

I have drastically improved the code for MazeNode.py and Maze.py so now they should be easier to work with.

I will begin coding the MazeSolver soon!

Also, this project is intended to be interpreted with Python 3.3 +.
