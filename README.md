# PythonMazeCode
This repository contains code written in Python 3.3 for Blackburn College's Fall 2016 Artificial Intelligence class CS370.

Update Sept 10, 2016:  The MazeCode is still buggy but I'll get it running soon!

Update Sept 16, 2016:  I have drastically improved the code for MazeNode.py and Maze.py so now they should be easier to work with.

Update Sept 18, 2016:  I have successfully coded the MazeSolver's A* algorithm!  The MazeSolver will now find the solution path without error.  This took me way longer to write than it should have but I did it  :D  I'll clean up the code sometime in the near future and add lots of comments... but right now it is 2am and I need sleep.

Update Sept 18, 2016:  I have successfully coded the MazeSolver's Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms!  I also wrote some code in CodeDriver to compare solve times.  I'm not really sure why but my A* algorithm is pretty slow at finding the solution path compared to DFS and BFS.  I guess it's because A* is doing lots of mathematical calculations to find the best path with the least amount of exploration.

Update Sept 20, 2016:  I have updated comments in MazeSolver and added some functions to CodeDriver to perform multiple maze solves for looking at the time / space complexity of my algorithms.  To be honest this code isn't really that great because of it's inefficiency but I had fun writing it and learned a lot about pathfinding algorithms so in my book that's a win.
