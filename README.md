# PythonMazeCode
This repository contains code written in Python 3.3 for Blackburn College's Fall 2016 Artificial Intelligence class CS370.

Update Sept 10, 2016:  The MazeCode is still buggy but I'll get it running soon!

Update Sept 16, 2016:  I have drastically improved the code for MazeNode.py and Maze.py so now they should be easier to work with.

Update Sept 18, 2016:  I have successfully coded the MazeSolver's A* algorithm!  The MazeSolver will now find the solution path without error.  This took me way longer to write than it should have but I did it  :D  I'll clean up the code sometime in the near future and add lots of comments... but right now I need sleep.
